Hi, this is my new portfolio / blog, if you want to go back to the old one with way too much effects and bloat (why tf did i used Vue/Nuxt), click [here](https://old.jlsquare.fr). 
I just wanted to make something simpler, almost everything here is just markdown. Made in Rust [here](https://github.com/JLsquare/md-blog-rs).

If you want to know me, [start here](/about)

If you want to see my projects, [go here](/projects)

And if you want to see me yapping, [it's here](/yapping)
