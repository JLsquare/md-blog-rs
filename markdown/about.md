I'm jl / Jean-Loup Mellion (I gave up my anonymity a long time ago), a 20 (20, damn) year-old computer science student at [IUT Vannes](https://www.iutvannes.fr/) in France, and a self-proclaimed professional git commit shitposter. 

My journey in tech began with game development maybe 10 years ago, where I started learning UnityScript (rip), then C# with Unity. It allowed me to meet a lot of really cool peoples, in random forums, on Discord on "game studios" that never really went anywhere.
But I quickly realized that the part I enjoyed the most was the algorithms of procedural generation, the networking, and all the low-level stuff.

Currently, next to my job where I'm a full-stack dev, I'm focused on machine learning, exploring algorithms and frameworks that complement my studies at university in:

- Systems programming and architecture
- Web development
- Cybersecurity
- Mathematics
- Data structures and algorithms
- Other things like management, communication...

Beyond academics, I'm passionate about:
- Personal projects (DO PROJECTS GUYS)
- Destroying other french universities in coding competitions. ex [24h INFO](https://24hinfo.iut.fr/)
- Slap bass (I'm beginning)
- Airsoft (piou piou, ratatatata)
- Driving XOR drinking
- Using Arch btw

My ultimate goal is to contribute to research in computer science, 
particularly trying new things pushing the boundaries of machine learning and its applications. 
I'm always open to discussing new ideas or collaborating on interesting projects. 
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or learn more.
