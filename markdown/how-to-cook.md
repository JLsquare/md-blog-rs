# how to cook other french universities

---

Sorry I'm dumb, and it's late.

My very short story at the national competition between french universities in computer science.

It's a 24h competition with no break, 3 tests of 8 hours each, algorithms, webdev, and cybersec, with a team of 4 / 5 people.
